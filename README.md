Hello Im instentbanjo :)

I've made a little game for the Micro:bit. 

You can either play it only with one Micro:bit, with only the [Player.py](https://github.com/instentbanjo/microbit-parkour-game/blob/main/Player.py) or you could use the system I implemented to save the results and the players etc. into a `.ini`-file. 
For further Information look at the [instructions](https://github.com/instentbanjo/microbit-parkour-game/blob/main/Instructions/Parkour_Setup_Instructions_EN.pdf)
